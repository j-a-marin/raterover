# Project Setup Instructions

Welcome! This guide will walk you through the steps required to get the QA app running on your local system. I've also streamlined deployment using Docker, and this setup includes running both a LangChain service and a Flask application.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-Git
-Docker
-Docker Compose
-Cloning the Repository
-Open a terminal on your computer

Clone the repository using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/j-a-marin/raterover.git
cd raterover
```
